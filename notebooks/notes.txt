World is for data
Scenario is for actions

World:  Populations, Spatial, Messages/Actions
Scenario:  Authority, Regulators, Movements, Indirect, Logger
		Method to pass in World


World has a single Authority
World has one or more Population
World has one or more Regulator each assigned to one or more Populations

Simulation has one or more Movement each assigned to one or more Population with consistent animal types
Simulation has one or more IndirectSpread each assigned to one or more Population

Authority defines FarmStatus enum which is respected by Regulator, Movement, and IndirectSpread
Population defines Disease enum and AnimalType enum which are respected by Regulator, Movement, and IndirectSpread
Regulator defines Observation enum which is respected by Authority

Each Disease enum must be translatable to:  Uninfected, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, Removed

Population outputs UEIRR numbers, along with Disease statuses, along with Infeted Y/N and Infectious Y/N

Authority outputs FarmStatus numbers, along with LastStatus and DeltaStatus
Authority also outputs overall outbreak status bool indicating if an outbreak is known to be active

Simulation has time step, and each spread/regulator/authority has a time increment option (default daily)
Simulation also outputs overall disease status bool indicating if there is any active infection left

We also need a Spatial class inside simulation to handle:
	Pairwise distance
	Pairwise neighbour
	Pairwise overlap
