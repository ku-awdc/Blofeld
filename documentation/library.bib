For complex dynamic systems, System Dynamics (SD) and Agent-based (AB) modelling are two widely used modelling paradigms that prior to the early 2010's have traditionally been viewed as mutually exclusive alternatives. This literature review seeks to update the work of Scholl (2001) and Macal, (2010) by providing an overview of attempts to integrate SD and AB over the last ten years. First, the building blocks of both paradigms are presented. Second, their capabilities are contrasted, in order to explore how their integration can yield insights that cannot be generated with one methodology alone. Then, an overview is provided of recent work comparing the outcomes of both paradigms and specifying opportunities for integration. Finally, a critical reflection is presented. The literature review concludes that while paradigm emulation has contributed to expanding the applications of SD, it is the dynamic combination of the two approaches that has become the most promising research line. Integrating SD and AB, and even tools and methods from other disciplines, makes it possible to avoid their individual pitfalls and, hence, to exploit the full potential of their complementary characteristics, so as to provide a more complete representation of complex dynamic systems.
